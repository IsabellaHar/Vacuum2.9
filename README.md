# Vacuum2.9

# Basic implentation of a vacuum agent, as per Question 2.9 in Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach, Global Edition : A Modern Approach

# Feel free to update to meet the following requirements: "our implementation should be modular so that the sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) can be changed easily."
